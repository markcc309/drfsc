## Removing correlated features

Though multicollinearity does not influence the predictions, it affects the coefficients and p-values. drfsc algorithm performs statistical t-test during the optimization procedure and presence of highly corelated features may adversely affect the algorithmâ€™s execution time. To account for this, the user can perform correlation analysis and remove desired correlated features by removing these columns. To ease the correlation analysis, the user can import `get_corr_df` from the `utils` module and call `get_corr_df(X, level)`, where `level` is the correlation threshold (by default 0.8). This DataFrame lists all features and corresponding correlation counts, i.e., number of features with which each feature is highly correlated.
